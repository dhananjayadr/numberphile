## Light Switch Problem

This script visualizes the state of light bulbs based on a specific pattern of toggling.

## Problem Statement

Imagine 100 light bulbs with light switches numbered 1 through 100, all initially in the off state. A series of operations is performed on the bulbs,

1. The first operation toggles the state of all bulbs.
2. The second operation toggles every second bulb (2, 4, 6, ...).
3. The third operation toggles every third bulb (3, 6, 9, ...).
4. This pattern continues until the 100th operation, which toggles the state of the 100th bulb.

By the end of these operations, certain bulbs will be in the on state, and others will be off. The challenge is to determine and visualize the state of the bulbs based on this pattern.

## Usage

1. Open the `bulb.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the slider to navigate through the steps of the operations.
3. Observe the visual representation of the light bulbs based on the specified pattern.
